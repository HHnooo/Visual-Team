[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrm_server.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rm_server", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rm_server" with
  any of the following names:

    rm_serverConfig.cmake
    rm_server-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rm_server" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rm_server_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rm_server" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
